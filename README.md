# Revolt Desktop

A desktop client for Revolt written using Electron.

## Developing

*Note that most of the actual app code is in [the Revite repo](https://github.com/revoltchat/revite) - Revolt Desktop is mainly a shell for Revite, and a lot of major functionality changes will need to be done in a locally hosted Revite instance. See its README for more info on setting one up.*

- Clone this repo
- Install deps with Yarn v3 (`yarn install`)
